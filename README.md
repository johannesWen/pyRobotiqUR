# pyRobotiq
`pyrobotiq` is a small Python library that provides a socket-based interface to Robotiq grippers mounted on Universal Robots (UR) controllers. It is designed to be simple to drop into an existing robotics stack while still exposing the core status and control features of the gripper. It uses the Robotiq URCap for communication.
